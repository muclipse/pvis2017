PacificVis 2017 features a short paper track, called "Visualization Notes". The purpose of this track is to encourage young researchers to present their work and discuss with participants including senior researchers there. The submissions can be late-breaking results and work in progress, while they should be novel enough to attract interest from the visualization community.
</p>
<p>
  Short paper submissions for the "Visualization Notes" can be up to <strong>a maximum of five (5) pages</strong> in length, with the caveat that an optional fifth page can only contain references. All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed through a single-stage process by the international program committee. The suggested topics for the "Visualization Notes" are the same as those for full papers, while the ideas there can be relatively small as compared with those for full papers. Nonetheless, the "Visualization Notes" are still expected to contain technically interesting results in theories and/or applications. Please note that all submissions must be original and thus have not been published elsewhere. Accepted short papers will be included in the conference proceedings and in <strong>IEEE digital library</strong>.
