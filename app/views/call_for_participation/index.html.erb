  The 10th IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis 2017) will be held in Seoul, Korea during April 18 to 21, 2017. Visualization has become an increasingly important research area due to its wide range of applications in many disciplines. PacificVis is an IEEE sponsored international visualization symposium held in the Asia-Pacific region, with the objective to foster greater exchange between visualization researchers and practitioners, and to draw more researchers in the Asia-Pacific region to enter this rapidly growing area of research.

  PacificVis 2017 features a short paper track, called "Visualization Notes". The purpose of this track is to encourage young researchers to present their work and discuss with participants including senior researchers there. The submissions can be late-breaking results and work in progress, while they should be novel enough to attract interest from the visualization community.
