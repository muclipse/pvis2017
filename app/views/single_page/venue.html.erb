  Since its inception in 1990, the Hoam Faculty House (HFH) has always stood by Seoul National University (SNU) noted for Korea's intellectual epicenter. As SNU's best support entity for education and research activities, it is well equipped with medium and large-sized meeting rooms for diverse conferences and events, restaurant for supply of safe and healthy food, and comfortable lodging facilities. Moreover, it runs a gallery for displaying works of notable artists, holds various concerts enjoyable for everyone, and undertakes ongoing renovations across installations and interior design, thereby evolving into a multiple cultural space where all visitors can build fond memories of their own.
