    'title': Emerging Topics in Visual Analytics
    'abstract': In the era of Big Data, visual analytics becomes an important tool for scientific research, engineering design, and critical decision making.  The design of a visual analytics solution must take into account the data characteristics, the media used, and the tasks to support, each of which presents some unique challenges. These challenges may suggest new topics for visual analytics research. I will discuss emerging topics in this area using research results that my group has produced as examples.

    'title': Telling Data-Driven Stories with Visualization 
    'abstract': Practitioners increasingly use visualizations “in the wild” to tell compelling stories supported by data, and continually develop novel techniques that help integrate data visualization into narrative stories. The visualization research community has recently begun to pay more attention to the need and use of visualization as a storytelling medium to tell engaging visual data-driven stories. However, data-driven storytelling research is still very much in its infancy and offers great opportunities to the visualization community. In this talk, I will present my recent research on data-driven storytelling to understand the data story creation process and to enable people to easily create visual data-driven stories. I will also discuss future research avenues in this exciting emerging field.
    'bio': Bongshin Lee is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research. She explores innovative ways for people to create visualizations, interact with data, and share data-driven stories. She has been recently focusing on helping people explore the data about themselves and share meaningful insights with others by leveraging visualizations. Bongshin currently serves as a General Co-Chair for IEEE PacificVis 2017 and an Associate Editor for IEEE TVCG, and served as a Papers Co-Chair for IEEE InfoVis 2015 & 2016. She earned her MS and PhD in Computer Science from University of Maryland at College Park in 2002 and 2006, respectively.

    'title': Visual Analytics of Urban Data
    'abstract': With the rapid development of sensing technologies and computing infrastructures, urban cities have been producing massive heterogeneous urban data on a daily basis, implying a wide spectrum of information and rich knowledge about the cities. Visual analytics, which facilitates analytical reasoning by interactive visual interfaces, have proven its value in solving various urban problems. In this talk, I will discuss our research experiences in visual analytics of big urban data, and  introduce several recent studies of our group of making sense of large-scale urban data through interactive visualization.
    'bio': Yingcai Wu is a ZJU100 Young Professor at the State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University.   He obtained his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Prior to his current position, Yingcai Wu was a researcher in the Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China from 2012 to 2015, and a postdoctoral researcher in the University of California, Davis from 2010 to 2012. His main research interests are in visual analytics, information visualization, and human computer interaction, with focuses on urban computing, social media analysis, text visualization, and behavior analysis. He has published more than 50 refereed papers and his three papers have been awarded Honorable Mention at IEEE VIS (SciVis) 2009, IEEE VIS (VAST) 2014, and IEEE PacificVis 2016.

    'title': Eye Tracking for Visual Analytics and Visual Analytics for Eye Tracking
    'abstract': "There is a growing interest in eye tracking as a research method in many communities, including visual analytics, information visualization, scientific visualization, but also in human-computer interaction, applied perception, psychology, cognitive science, security, and mixed reality. Progress in hardware technology and the reduction of costs for eye tracking devices have made this analysis technique accessible to a large population of researchers. Recording the observer’s gaze can reveal how dynamic graphical displays are visually accessed and which information are processed in real time. However, the analysis, interaction, and visualization of spatiotemporal gaze data becomes a challenging factor in this emerging discipline. My talk will discuss the relationship between eye tracking and visual analytics from two angles: (1) How can eye tracking help understand how users work with visual analytics interfaces, thus serving as a basis to improve visual analytics? (2) How can visual analytics facilitate the analysis of eye tracking recordings? I will argue that it is useful to combine both perspectives, eventually targeting \"visual analytics for visual analytics\"."

    'title': New Quality Metrics for Graph Visualisation
    'abstract': "Quality metrics are significant simply because they measure success or failure of a graph drawing method. Most importantly, they are used as optimisation goals in designing graph drawing algorithms. This talk will present two new family of quality metrics for graph drawing: faithfulness and shape-based metrics. We illustrate these metrics with examples, and apply the metrics to data from previous experiments, leading to the suggestion that the new metrics are effective."
