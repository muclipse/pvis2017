I alsointerviewed Dr. Stasko for more insights. The story tries to point out somecommon trends and anomalies among the IEEE papers.As for the design process, I started with literature review and case studies onnarrative visualization, and then came up with a storyline with key insights. Afterthis stage, I brainstormed different ways of visualization and quickly generatedsome design mockups, before finally building it into the interactive version."contest-103,The Birth of a Virtual Cell,sorger@cg.tuwien.ac.at,"Peter Mindek, Johannes Sorger, Tobias Klein, David Kouřil, Daniel Toloudis, Gregory R. Johnson, Liya Ding, Graham Johnson, Ivan Viola","In our current research project, we are working on theinteractive visualization of cellular data at multiple scales. Thevisual story telling contest motivated us to describe the process ofbringing this complex volumetric data ""to life"". We scripted thevisual story directly within the current build of our multi-scalevisualization. The entire video is therefore rendered in real time.This enabled us to directly show the steps involved in therendering of our final visualization based on the actual data andthe actual algorithms that are applied. The various effects in thevideo are therefore parameter variables for existing multi-scalevisualization functions that change over time.The final result of our visualization was inspired by a renderingof the reference 3D model that was created by a scientificillustrator. The challenge that we overcome in our visualizationwas to create a rendering of the original data at stable 30 framesper second that matches the offline rendered illustration in visualquality, which helps to clarify the complex 3D arrangements ofthe inner components of the cell. "contest-106,Rescue Signatures in the Mediterranean,myjyby@gmail.com,"Jeremy Boy, Katherine Hoffmann, Amanda Zerbe, Felicia Vacarelu, Miguel Luengo-Oroz","This video shows how Automatic Identification System (AIS) datacan reveal patterns of rescue operations of refugee and migrant boatsin the Mediterranean sea. Vessel AIS is a maritime communicationssystem that provides data about vessel identity, type, position, speed,etc. It allows ships to communicate with each other and shorestations; and marine authorities to monitor vessels. All images in thisvideo were drawn by hand. Those based on data graphics were tracedover charts and map projections generated with d3.js. The motivationfor hand drawings was to move away from the rather impersonal andcold vector renderings that information visualizations often assume.We believe this approach is more appropriate seeing the humannature of the crisis addressed."contest-108,Bullies and Victims: How Bullying Incidents Vary in Grades and How They are Reported,kw@ucdavis.edu,"Oh-Hyun Kwon, Jia-Kai Chou, Kwan-Liu Ma","We analyze a friendship and aggression network collected from a group of high school students (8th–12th graders) [1]. Wedepict social behaviors among the studied subjects by designing a visualization that allows us to answer questions like ‘Do bullyingtendencies change among students in grades?’ and ‘How likely is a bullying incident would be reported by the victim, other peers,or the bully?’ A node-link diagram succinctly shows the relationships between individuals. Its layout was designed to reveal bothfriendship and grade information, while directionally animated edges indicate the type of social relationships between students. Nodecolor indicates each student’s tendency to be a bully or a victim, and size denotes the number of reported bully-related incidents, as anaggressor or a recipient. (Our slideshow is web-based.

Here, we use the datavisualization to test this hypothesis: enterprise ranking can reflect economic growth.From those visualizations, we can conclude that China enterprises' performance isgetting better, and there is a trend that more following enterprises are entering theFortune 500 list. Likewise, there are more Hongkong enterprises on Fortune list, andbasically, Hongkong enterprises' rankings are going upward. As for the part ofTaiwan, the change trend is ups and downs, and fewer new enterprises showing on thelist. Let's look back at the theme, China and Taiwan economy reflect on Fortune 500.As for Hong Kong's economic boom in recent years, we cannot observe thisphenomenon from the fortune 500 visualizations."contest-110,"The New ""Lipstick Effect"" -- Hit Korean drama boosts sales of lipstick products",120737158@qq.com,"FEI FANG, WEI ZHANG","A new kind of ""Lipstick Effect"" occurred in Asia during the pastfive years, as more and more Korean drama shows began to leadthe trend in lipstick shades, and some even caused certain lipstickshortage. Customers are more willing to buy the lipsticks thatappeared on some popular Korean drama shows. We collected allthe search results (750 in total) of ""Korean drama + Lipstick"" atBaidu.com, which is the biggest search engine in China; thenscraped the main articles of all these results (about 327,000 words),and calculated the occurrence of each lipstick shade from thecollected text dataset. Then we used the data to analysis andvisualize the popular lipstick shades, drama shows, cosmetic brandsinvolved in this effect, and finally further proved the effect usingGoogle Trend data. The visualizations can be viewed in thesubmitted video or on https://feifang.github.io/New-LipstickEffect/."contest-111,How Wind Affects Air Pollution in Beijing?,pkuluke@gmail.com,"Ziping Xu, Haochuan Xu","We try to find the interaction between winds and air pollution. A story is revealed in this way. Winds from different directions have significantly different effects. Besides, we also find that some heavy polluted area may be a result of geographical factors, for example, mountains. Parade effect, a special period, that experience an extreme good weather is also revealed in this story. "contest-114,Summarizing the U.S. Presidential Election Day 2016,cjbryan@ucdavis.edu,"Chris Bryan, Keshav Dasu, Sravya Divakarla, Kwan-Liu Ma","Temporal Summary Images (TSIs) were introduced at InfoVis 2016as an approach for complex dataset summarization and narrative storytelling.We use this framework, which combines small multipleswith linked time-dependent visualizations and overlaid annotations,to build a data-driven infographic of the U.S. presidential electionday– November 08, 2016. The result uses several online data sources:hashtags extracted from over twelve million tweets, electoral collegeresults, predicted winner forecasting, and blog posts scraped fromthe election live blogs of several news organizations. Blog sourcesare grouped by political bias and sentiment analysis has been appliedto their posts. Annotations provide additional context aboutthe data streams and highlight important temporal events throughoutthe night. By combining automatic data generation and layout withmanual refinement and visual design, TSIs allowed for a streamlineddesign in producing presentation-quality graphics."contest-116,"Ferment and Counter Revolution: A Visual Storytelling for ""Gauze Event"" in Social Media",simingchen3@gmail.com,"Zhibang Jiang, Siming Chen, Shuai Chen, Yumiao Sun, Xiaoru Yuan","We crawl the data from Sina Weibo (the largest microblog service inChina) of specific events by setting the keywords. After aggregatingthe extracted data, we construct multiple reposting trees. Afterward,we merge these trees into a compact map. The hexagon representsone or a group of people, and each color represents the detectedcommunity. For each community, the nodes are laid out from centerout in a chronological order. Multiple interactions and animationsare supported to reveal the event evolutions. With the D-Map, wecan tell the stories with multiple event stages, by identifying themain themes, key players and the diffusion paths interactively."contest-117,College Scorecard - Comparing Purdue with Surrounding Universities,li1940@purdue.edu,Mingran Li,"This narrative visualization aims to compare Purdue with surroundinguniversities in the aspects of Cost, Aid, Repayment, Completion,and Earnings. By applying the concept of College Scorecard, whichmakes it easier for students to search for a college that is a good fitfor them, readers can find out more about a college’s affordabilityand value so that they can make more informed determines aboutwhich college to attend. The designer created the visualization byAdobe Photoshop, which helped to implement the entire interfaceby mapping the background U.S. map with three different colors ofpixel shapes, and rendering the universities that in the comparisonof Purdue and the surrounded by another three colors, which stillcame from the same color scheme with the U.S. map. In addition,the usages of those four independent pixel maps were conductedfor presenting the comparable valuations of Aid, Repayment, Completion,and Earnings between Purdue (IN) with the universities ofthe first rendered ring, including IA, MN, MI, WV, KY, and TN. Ascatter plot with pixel squares was designed for displaying the informationof Cost with all rendered states, which was well-organizedin yellow, orange and green’s annulus. By applying the severity ratingsin the heuristic evaluation, designer obtained many constructivesuggestions to help design modifications and improvements.Dataset - https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/college-scorecard"
