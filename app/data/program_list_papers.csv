A successful MMORPG should engage players and meet their needs to achieve different categories of gratifications. Research on the evolution of player social interaction network and the dynamics of inter-player intimacy could provide insights into players' gratification-oriented behaviors in MMORPGs. Such understanding could in turn guide game designs for better engaging existing players and marketing strategies for attracting newcomers. Conventional dynamic network analysis may help investigate game-based social interactions at the macroscopic level. However, current dynamic network visualization techniques mainly focus on illustrating topological changes of the entire network, which are unsuitable for analyzing player-specific social interactions in the virtual world from an egocentric perspective. In general, game designers and operators find it difficult to analyze the way players with different gratification needs may interact with one another and the consequences on their relationships with direct ties, using a decentralized social graph with complicated time-varying structures. In this paper, we present MMOSeer, a visual analytics system for exploring the evolution of egocentric player intimacy network. MMOSeer focuses on the relationship between a player (ego) and his/her directly-linked friends (alters). We follow a user-centered design process to develop the system with game analysts and apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established algorithms to depict the evolution of intimacy egocentric network. We also derive a centrality change metric to infer how the impact of changes in an ego's interactive behaviors may propagate through the intimacy network, reshaping the structure of the alters' social circles at both micro and macro levels. Finally, we validate the usability of MMOSeer by discovering different user interaction patterns and the corresponding ego-network structural changes in a real-world gameplay dataset from a commercial MMORPG.",Cover Letter/Report of Changes.pdf,papers_1101-file1.pdf,MMOSeer.mp4,papers_1101-file2.mp4,,,,,Quan Li,yes,2017.2.8 21:34,papers_1246,Designing Interactive Distance Cartograms to Support Urban Travelers,"Sungsoo (Ray) Hong, Rafal Kocielnik, Min-Joon Yoo, Sarah Battersby, Juho Kim, Cecilia Aragon","rayhong@uw.edu, rkoc@uw.edu, mjy261@nyu.edu, sbattersby@tableau.com, juhokim@kaist.ac.kr, aragon@uw.edu",Sungsoo (Ray),Hong,rayhong@uw.edu,University of Washington,,,,,,,,Rafal,Kocielnik,rkoc@uw.edu,University of Washington,,,,,,,,Min-Joon,Yoo,mjy261@nyu.edu,New York University,,,,,,,,Sarah,Battersby,sbattersby@tableau.com,Tableau Research,,,,,,,,Juho,Kim,juhokim@kaist.ac.kr,KAIST,,,,,,,,Cecilia,Aragon,aragon@uw.edu,University of Washington,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A distance cartogram (DC) is a technique that alters distances between a user-specified origin and the other locations in a map with respect to travel time. With DC, users can weigh the relative travel time costs between origin and potential destinations at a glance because travel times are projected in a linearly interpolated time space from the origin. Such glance-ability is known to be useful for travelers who are mindful of travel time when finding their travel destinations. When constructing DC, however, uneven urban traffic conditions can introduce excessive distortion and challenge a map readers窶 intuition about true travel time. In addition, there has been little research on understanding the role of user interaction for improving DC. To realize the full potential of DC in real-world settings as an interactive decision-making support tool, we devise two techniques called Geo-contextual Anchoring Projection and Scalable Road-network Construction and derive a set of interactions through two formative studies. We develop an interactive map system by incorporating the two techniques and the interactions and evaluate the system by comparing it against an equidistant map (EM), a widely used conventional layout that preserves the geographic reality.

A recent and promising area of research is to replace the dataset with a distribution based proxy representation that summarizes scalar information into a much reduced memory footprint. Proposed representations subdivide the dataset into local blocks, where each block holds important statistical information, such as a histogram. A key drawback is that a distribution representing the scalar values in a block lacks spatial information. This manifests itself as large errors in visualization algorithms. We present a novel statistically-based representation by augmenting the block-wise distribution based representation with location information, called a value-based spatial distribution. Information from both spatial and scalar spaces are combined using Bayes' rule to accurately estimate the data value at a given spatial location. The representation is compact using the Gaussian Mixture Model.

The study entails understanding the state of the Earth's atmosphere, how it is changing over time and why. Understanding how various weather events develop and evolve is often conducted through retrospective analysis of past atmospheric events. Atmospheric scientists can then utilize tools to better predict potential hazards and provide earlier warnings for events that may impact life and property. Several atmospheric state variables can be measured to identify high-impact events, one of which is surface atmospheric pressure. Many weather events are characterized by variations in surface pressure from the mean pressure value (i.e., pressure-perturbations). Accordingly, there is significant interest in extracting and tracking pressure-perturbations both spatially and temporally to better understand the evolution of weather events. \  \ Here, we present a visualization and analysis environment that allows interactive exploration of pressure-perturbation data sets. Our system, for the first time, enables scientists to interactively explore the spatiotemporal behaviors of pressure-perturbations for a range of values and provides support to leverage other conventional data sets.

Our framework leverages coordinated multiple views to reveal the network structure at three levels of detail (i.e., the global, local, and individual port levels). Users can quickly identify ports of interest at the global level and specify a port to investigate its higher-order nodes at the individual port level. Investigating a larger-scale impact is enabled through the exploration of HoN at the local level. Using the global ocean shipping network data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a real-world use case conducted by domain experts specializing in species invasion.

Thereby, colors representing a higher share of the dataset are depicted more prominently, thus providing a higher sensitivity for fine-tuning TF widgets.

Exploring scalar uncertain data modeled as probability distribution fields is a challenging task because the underlying features are often more complex, and the data associated with each grid point are high dimensional. In this work, we present a compact and effective representation, called range likelihood tree, to summarize and explore probability distribution fields. The key idea is to decompose and summarize each complex probability distribution over a few representative subranges by cumulative probabilities, and allow users to consider the roles that different subranges play in understanding the probability distributions. In our method, the value domain is first partitioned into subranges, then the distribution at each grid point is transformed according to the cumulative probabilities of the point's distribution in those subranges. Organizing the subranges into a hierarchical structure based on how these cumulative probabilities are spatially distributed in the grid points, the new range likelihood tree representation allows effective classification and identification of features through user query and exploration. We present an exploration framework with multiple interactive views to explore probability distribution fields, and provide guidelines for visual exploration using our framework.

In this paper, we present SwiftTuna, a holistic system that streamlines the visual information seeking process on large-scale multidimensional data.

In this paper, we present an interactive workflow to allow users to design multivariate transfer functions. To handle large scale datasets, in the preprocessing stage we reduce the number of data points through data binning and aggregation, and then a new set of data points with a much smaller size are generated. The relationship between all pairs of variables is presented in a matrix juxtaposition view, where users can navigate through the different subspaces. An entropy based method is used to help users to choose which subspace to explore. We proposed two weights: scatter weight and size weight that are associated with each projected point in those different subspaces. Based on those two weights, data point filter and kernel density estimation operations are employed to assist users to discover interesting features. For each user-selected feature, a Gaussian function is constructed and updated incrementally. Finally, all those selected features are visualized through multivariate volume rendering to reveal the structure of data.

Although understanding these regions could provide huge insights to facilitate valuable applications for urban planning and business intelligence, few methods have been developed to effectively capture the rapid transformation of urban regions. In recent years, the widely applied location-acquisition technologies offer a more effective way to capture the dynamics of a city through analyzing people's movement activities based on mobility data. However, several challenges exist, including data sparsity and difficulties in result understanding and validation. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose MobiSeg, an interactive visual analytics system, which supports the exploration of people's movement activities to segment the urban area into regions sharing similar activity patterns. A joint analysis is conducted on three types of heterogeneous mobility data (i.e., taxi trajectories, metro passenger RFID card data, and telco data), which can complement each other and provide a full picture of people's activities in a region. In addition, advanced analytical algorithms (e.g., non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to capture latent activity patterns, as well as metric learning to calibrate and supervise the underlying analysis) and novel visualization designs are integrated into our system to provide a comprehensive solution to region segmentation in urban areas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system via case studies with real-world datasets and qualitative interviews with domain experts.

The approach is extensible to different analysis tasks. To test its performance in a realistic setting, we pre-calibrated it for correlation estimation, class separation, and outlier detection.
