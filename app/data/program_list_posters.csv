Each process is initially assigned a regularly partitioned block along with duplicated ghost layer under the memory limit. During particle tracing, the k-d tree decomposition is dynamically performed by constraining the cutting planes in the overlap range of duplicated data. This ensures that each process is reassigned particles as even as possible, and on the other hand the new assigned particles for a process always locate in its block.

Astrocytes are nonneuronal cells in the brain, which are support structures for neurons. In order to image astrocytes and their fine sub-structures, high resolution imaging is required. However, the complex and widely branching morphology of astrocytes makes visualization and analysis challenging. Most previous visualization research has focused on the analysis of neurons and synapses, while ignoring the analysis of astrocytes. In Abstractocyte, biologists can simultaneously explore the morphology of astrocyte cells while analysing neighboring neurons and their neural connectivity. We allow users to explore their data at different levels of abstraction. Users can go from a concrete, highly-detailed 3D view to a simplified and abstracted 2D view of the same data. This abstraction can be done independently for astrocytes as well as for neurites, thereby spanning a 2D space of possible abstraction levels. Our system morphs from one abstraction level to the next, either by smoothly interpolating, or by snapping from one abstraction level to the next. Such approach is of particular interest to assess astrocytic coverage of synapses, a feature of great interest to neuroscientists as the morphological relationship between astrocytes and neurons impacts energy support, recycling of transmitters, and fine-tuning of synaptic activity.
